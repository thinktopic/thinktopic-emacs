;; Blackboard Colour Theme for Emacs.
;;
;; Defines a colour scheme resembling that of the original TextMate Blackboard colour theme.
;; To use add the following to your .emacs file (requires the color-theme package):
;;
;; (require 'color-theme)
;; (color-theme-initialize)
;; (load-file "~/.emacs.d/themes/color-theme-blackboard.el")
;;
;; And then (color-theme-blackboard) to activate it.
